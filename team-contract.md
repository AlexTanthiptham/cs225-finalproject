CS 225 Data Structures
Team Contract (kirilk2-jt20-jguerr43-dzlee2)

Communication
1. Team Meetings
Our team will meet once every week on Thursdays from 3-5 PM at the Campus Instructional Facility or Grainger Library. Each member will rotate being the designated note taker. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting by the document’s revision history. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly development log entry which is approved by the team and committed to github at the start of the following week’s meeting. Additional work meetings via zoom may be scheduled as needed. Weekly meetings can be rescheduled if 2 or more members cannot attend.

2. Assistance
Each team member can be contracted through email or Discord. Outside of emergencies, we commit to responding to messages on Discord within 24 hours.

3. Respect
The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by a simple majority. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

Collaboration
1. Work Distribution
Each week, progress milestones for the next meeting and necessary deliverables will be determined by the full team during the weekly in-person meetings. Each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, team members may be randomly assigned to work on the tasks. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.

2. Time Commitment
Ensuring an equal distribution of work, we expect each member to work 2-6 hours per week on this project. If there are unforeseen circumstances that prevent a team member from working this amount of hours, it must be communicated to the rest of the group so things can be arranged accordingly.

3. Conflict Resolution
Conflicts within the team will be decided by a 50m dash on conflicts regarding the project decisions. If a certain individual is habitually late or has an unexcused absence (more than twice in a row) then they will pay everybody in the team with a boba tea drink. If the problem persists we will get course staff involved to help resolve the issue.

If this was an MD file, each of us would sign our names here at the bottom with an electronic signature and a separate github commit over the same document.
